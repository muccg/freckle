Code by Crispin Wellington <cwellington@ccg.murdoch.edu.au>

This is a library to implement the Yue Huang and Ling Zhang 2004 dot plot algorithm outlined in their
2004 paper, "Rapid and sensitive dot-matrix methods for genome analysis", Bioinformatics 20(4) Oxford University Press.

Approach
--------

1. Storage of results

In order to trade off between speed and storage in an efficient manner, the results are stored in objects of the class
DotStore. DotStore contains a doubly linked list of DotStorageChunks. A DotStorageChunk is an array style storage of Dots.
In this way it is a continuous block of RAM with little overhead. Access is rapid and through DotStore the size can grow
and shrink. As it stands, DotStorageChunk contains 8192 Dots. LIMITATIONS: as its coded, little attention is paid to deleting
or optimising deletions of dots in the results. This can be coded, but is intentionally left minimal (and slow) because
a typical use pattern will be to fill the storage with a (very) large number of dots, and then once the dots are plotted,
delete the entire structure at once.
